## Stakeholders

#### **Interviewees: Yinuo Song & Kevin Ni – Indecisive Eaters**  

### **Problems / Frustrations**  
- Struggles with Deciding What to Eat: This often leads to repetitive meals or even skipping meals.   
- Ingredient Waste: Users frequently buy groceries without a plan, resulting in expired/unfresh food.
- Lack of Integrated Cooking & Dining Apps: Most apps focus solely on either recipes or restaurant discovery, making it difficult to switch between the two.  
- Unclear Nutritional Information: Users struggle to track calories, macronutrients, and overall meal healthiness when cooking at home.  
- Difficulty Finding Suitable Recipes: Users with dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan) struggle to find recipes that match their needs.  

### **Goals / Needs**  
- Easy Meal Planning: Step-by-step text or video tutorials for guided cooking.
- Smart Ingredient Utilization: Enable users to select available food for recipe suggestions, reducing ingredient waste by recommending meals based on what's already in the kitchen.
- Seamless Home-Cooking & Dining-Out Experience: An all-in-one platform that allows easy switching between cooking at home and finding restaurants.
- Nutritional Insights: Each recipe includes caloric information and macronutrient breakdowns (proteins, carbs, fats).
- Personalized Recipe Filtering: Automated meal planner that suggests recipes matching dietary preferences and filters out allergens and disliked ingredients.
